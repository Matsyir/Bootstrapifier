# Bootstrapifier
Parse basic HTML and add simple bootstrap classes to make the page look nicer at the click of a button.

You don't need to download any of the source to parse your HTML, simply paste your HTML in the github site and copy the output: https://matsyir.github.io/Bootstrapifier/

Very much a WIP right now, but its core functionality is there.

Using the very permissive MIT License. Feel free to omit any copyright notices from pages generated using Bootstrapifier. You must only keep the copyright notice around the actual Bootstrapifier.js class, whether you are simply using it in a page or creating your own version/fork (not expecting people to use it that way). Feel free to make a pull request or open an issue to suggest improvements.
